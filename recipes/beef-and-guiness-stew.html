    <h1>Beef and Guiness Stew</h1>
    <img src="../img/stew" alt="Photograph of Beef and Guiness stew served on mashed potatoes in a white ceramic bowl">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> This flavorful beef stew is seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li><strong>Beer:</strong> Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such as Guinness).</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato paste:</strong> Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade broth. You can use chicken or beef stock.</li>
    </ul>
