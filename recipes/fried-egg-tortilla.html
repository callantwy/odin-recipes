            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li><strong>Butter: </strong>2 teaspoons</li>
                <li><strong>Egg: </strong>1 large</li>
                <li><strong>Taco Seasoning:</strong> 1/4 teaspoon, or to taste</li>
                <li><strong>Cheddar Cheese:</strong> 1 1/2 ounces shredded, divided</li>
                <li><strong>Flour Tortilla:</strong> 1 (6 to 7-inch)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol class="instructions">
                <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
                <li>Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.</li>
                <li>Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
