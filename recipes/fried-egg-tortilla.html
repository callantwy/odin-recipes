    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p class="green-background">Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="green-background">
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="heading">Instructions</h4>
    <ol class="green-background">
        <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
        <li>Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.</li>
        <li>Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
